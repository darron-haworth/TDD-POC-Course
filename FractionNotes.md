Test cases:

Whole numbers
 0  +  0  =   0  **DONE
 5  +  0  =   3  **DONE
 0  +  5  =   5  **DONE
 5  +  8 =   13  **DONE
-3  +  0  =  -3  **DONE
 0  + -6  =  -6  **DONE

 1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5 **DONE
 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/2 - Common denoms
 3/4 + 3/4 = 3/2 needs reduce

 1/3 + 2/3  = 1
 1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5

 3 / 4 + 5/8 = 11/8 ** Needs to reduce
 1/6 + 4/9 = 11/18

 -1/4 + 3/4 = 1/2
 3/8 + -1/2 = -1/8
